## Case Study Questions - Ingredient Optimisation

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

2. What was the most commonly added extra?

3. What was the most common exclusion?

4. Generate an order item for each record in the `customers_orders` table in the format of one of the following:

   - `Meat Lovers`
   - `Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`
   - `Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon`
   - `Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`

5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.
   For example: `"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"`

6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

## Solutions:

All the queries are written using `MySQL`. 
Firstly create all the necessary tables and databases before running on your local machine.

### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

```sql
SELECT 
	pizza_name, 
	GROUP_CONCAT(topping_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS ingredients
FROM pizza_names pn
JOIN pizza_recipes pr ON pn.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_toppings pt  ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id,REPLACE(toppings, ' ','')) > 0
GROUP BY pizza_name;
```

#### Result set:
| pizza_name | ingredients | 
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Meatlovers | Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami |
| Vegetarian | Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce |

---

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

```sql
WITH extras_per_order AS (
SELECT 
	order_id,
	customer_id,
	extras,
	topping_name, 
	topping_id AS extras_seperated
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_toppings ON FIND_IN_SET(topping_id, REPLACE(extras,' ','')) > 0
)
SELECT 
	extras_seperated, 
	topping_name, 
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_times_added
FROM extras_per_order
GROUP BY extras_seperated, topping_name
ORDER BY number_of_times_added DESC, extras_seperated;
```

#### Result set:

|extras_seperated | topping_name | number_of_times_added |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1		  | Bacon        | 4         |
| 4		  | Cheese       | 1         |
| 5		  | Chicken      | 1         |

---

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?

```sql
WITH exclusion_per_order AS (
SELECT 
	order_id,
	customer_id,
	exclusions,
	topping_name, 
	topping_id AS exclusion_seperated
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_toppings ON FIND_IN_SET(topping_id, REPLACE(exclusions,' ','')) > 0
)
SELECT 
	exclusion_seperated, 
	topping_name, 
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_times_added
FROM exclusion_per_order
GROUP BY exclusion_seperated, topping_name
ORDER BY number_of_times_added DESC, exclusion_seperated;
```

#### Result set:

| exclusion_seperated | topping_name | number_of_times_added |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 4 		      | Cheese       | 4         |
| 2 		      | BBQ Sauce    | 1         |
| 6		      | Mushrooms    | 1         |

### 4. Generate an order item for each record in the `customers_orders` table in the format of one of the following:

- `Meat Lovers`
- `Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`
- `Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon`
- `Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`

```sql
WITH extras_list AS (
	SELECT 	order_id, 
		customer_id, 
            	extras,
            	GROUP_CONCAT(topping_name, ' ') AS toppings
	FROM	customer_orders c
	JOIN pizza_toppings ON FIND_IN_SET(topping_id, REPLACE(extras, ' ','')) > 0
	GROUP BY order_id, customer_id, extras
), exclusion_list AS (
	SELECT 	c.order_id, 
		customer_id, 
            	exclusions,
            	GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT topping_name, ' ') AS toppings
	FROM customer_orders c
	JOIN pizza_toppings ON FIND_IN_SET(topping_id, REPLACE(exclusions, ' ','')) > 0
	GROUP BY c.order_id, customer_id, exclusions
)

SELECT 
	c.order_id,
	c.customer_id,
    	CONCAT(p.pizza_name,
    	CASE
		WHEN c.exclusions IS NOT NULL THEN CONCAT(' - Exclude ', exl.toppings) ELSE '' 
	END,
    	CASE
		WHEN c.extras IS NOT NULL THEN CONCAT(' - Extras ',el.toppings) ELSE ''
	END) AS order_description
FROM customer_orders c 
JOIN pizza_names p USING(pizza_id)
LEFT JOIN extras_list el USING(order_id)
LEFT JOIN exclusion_list exl USING(order_id)
ORDER BY 1,2;
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | customer_id | order_description                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |
| 2        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |

### 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.

For example: `"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"`

```sql
-- To be done
```
#### Result set:

---

### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

```sql
WITH BaseIngredients as (
    SELECT   pt.topping_id,
             COUNT(*) as base_count 
    FROM customer_orders c 
    JOIN pizza_recipes pr ON c.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id 
    JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, REPLACE(pr.toppings, ' ','')) > 0
    JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    GROUP BY 1
), Extras as (
    SELECT
	   topping_id AS extras,
           COUNT(*) as extra_count
    FROM  customer_orders c
    JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, REPLACE(extras,' ','')) > 0
    WHERE extras IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1
), Exclusions AS(
	SELECT	
		topping_id AS exclusions,
		COUNT(*) AS exclusion_count
	FROM customer_orders c
    	JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, REPLACE(exclusions, ' ','')) > 0
   	WHERE exclusions IS NOT NULL
    	GROUP BY 1
), TotalIngredients as (
    SELECT  
	   topping_id,
           (COALESCE(base_count, 0) + COALESCE(extra_count, 0)- COALESCE(exclusion_count,0)) as total_count
    FROM BaseIngredients Bi 
    LEFT JOIN Extras e ON Bi.topping_id = e.extras 
    LEFT JOIN Exclusions ex ON Bi.topping_id = ex.exclusions
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name,
         ti.total_count
FROM TotalIngredients ti 
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON ti.topping_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

#### Result set:


| topping_name | total_count |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Bacon	       | 14	     |
| Mushrooms    | 13	     | 
| Cheese       | 11          |
