## Solutions:

All the queries are written using `MySQL`. 
Firstly create all the necessary tables and databases before running on your local machine.

### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) AS pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders;
```

#### Result set:

| pizzas_ordered |
| ---------------|
| 14             |

---

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
FROM customer_orders;
```

#### Result set:

| unique_orders |
| ------------- |
| 10            |

---

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(*) AS successful_orders
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | successful_orders |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 4                 |
| 2         | 3                 |
| 3         | 1                 |

---

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT 
	pizza_name, 
	COUNT(c.order_id) AS No_of_pizzas_delivered
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pizza_name;
```

#### Result set:

| pizza_name | No_of_pizzas_delivered |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Meatlovers | 9                      |
| Vegetarian | 3                      |

---

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

```sql
WITH customers_orders AS (
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	pizza_name
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
)
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Meatlovers",
	SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_name = 'Vegetarian' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Vegetarian'
FROM customers_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | Meatlovers | Vegetarian |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 101         | 2          | 1          |
| 102         | 2 	   | 1          |
| 103         | 3 	   | 1          |
| 104         | 3 	   | 0          |
| 105         | 0 	   | 1          |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

```sql
SELECT 
	c.order_id , 
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_pizzas
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id
ORDER BY number_of_pizzas DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | number_of_pizzas |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 4        | 3                |

---

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS no_change,
	SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS atleast_one_change  
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | no_change | atleast_one_change |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| 101         | 2         | 0    	       |
| 102         | 3         | 0        	       |

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS pizzas_with_both
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL AND c.exclusions IS NOT NULL AND c.extras IS NOT NULL;
```

| pizzas_with_both |
| ---------------- |
| 1                |

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

```sql
SELECT day(order_time) AS date_of_month ,hour(order_time) AS hours, COUNT(*) AS volume
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY day(order_time), hours;
```

#### Result set:


| week_of_month | hours | volume |
| ------------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1	        | 18    | 1      |
| 1		| 19    | 1      |

| 10		| 11    | 1      |
| 11		| 18    | 2      |

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

```sql
SELECT 
	WEEK(order_time) AS week_of_month,
