## Case Study Questions - Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

```sql
SELECT 
	WEEK(registration_date, 1) AS week_of_month, 	COUNT(runner_id) AS No_of_runners
FROM runners
GROUP BY week_of_month;
```

#### Result set:

| week_of_month | No_of_runners |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0             | 2             |
| 1             | 1             |
| 2             | 1             |

---

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

```sql
SELECT 
	runner_id,
	AVG(MINUTE(TIMEDIFF(pickup_time,order_time))) AS avg_arrival_time
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | avg_arrival_time |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | 15.33            |
| 2         | 23.40            |
| 3         | 10.00            |

---

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

```sql
SELECT 
	c.order_id,COUNT(*) AS num_of_pizzas,
	AVG(MINUTE(TIMEDIFF(pickup_time,order_time))) AS avg_order_prep_dur 
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id
ORDER BY c.order_id, num_of_pizzas DESC;```

#### Result set:

| order_id | num_of_pizzas | avg_order_prep_dur |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1	   | 1	           | 10.0000		|
| 2	   | 1	           | 10.0000		|
| 3	   | 2	           | 21.0000		|
| 4	   | 3	           | 29.0000		|
| 5	   | 1	           | 10.0000		|
| 7	   | 1	           | 10.0000		|
| 8	   | 1	           | 20.0000		|
| 10	   | 2	           | 15.0000		|

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

```sql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id, 
	ROUND(AVG(CAST(distance AS signed)),2) AS avg_distance_travelled
FROM customer_orders c 
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | avg_distance_travelled |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 101         | 20.00                  |
| 102         | 16.33                  |
| 103         | 23.00                  |
| 104         | 10.00                  |
| 105         | 25.00                  |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

```sql
SELECT 
	(MAX(CAST(duration as signed)) - MIN(CAST(duration AS signed)) ) AS delivery_time_diff
FROM runner_orders;

```

#### Result set:


| delivery_time_diff |
| ------------------ |
| 30		     |

---

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

```sql
SELECT 
	runner_id, 
	order_id, 
	distance/(duration/60) AS avg_speed_kmph
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
ORDER BY 1;

-- remarks: 

Given default duration is in minutes --> so in order to convert into hours (to get speed in km/hr), we divide the duration by 60. 
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | order_id | average_speed |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1 	    | 1	       | 37.50 	       |
| 1 	    | 2        | 44.44         |
| 1 	    | 3        | 40.20         |
| 1 	    | 10       | 60.00         |
| 2 	    | 7        | 60.00 	       |
| 2 	    | 8        | 93.60         |
| 2 	    | 4        | 35.10         |
| 3 	    | 5        | 40.00         |



---

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

```sql
SELECT 
	runner_id, 
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 END)*100/COUNT(*),2) as successful_delivery_percentage
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

#### Result set:


| runner_id | successful_delivery_percentage |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1         | 100.00			     |
| 2 	    | 75.00 			     |
| 3 	    | 50.00 			     |
